Python in the lab: a short introductory course
==============================================

This is a collection of Ipython notebooks used for a Python-in-the-lab 20-hour course, first given at the Politecnico of Turin, Italy in Jan-Feb 2017.

The idea is to learn the essential elements of Python by trying to immediately work with problems a PhD student or a researcher can find daily in a lab: as open files, plot, fitting, image analysis, etc.

To open the notebooks, download the files to a directory on your computer and from that directory run:

    $ ipython notebook

This will open a new page in your browser with a list of the available notebooks.

Should this error `[TerminalIPythonApp] WARNING | File not found: u'notebook'` pop up, please install Jupyter by following the [instructions](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) and execute the following command to run the notebook:

    $ jupyter notebook

The Bk.zip file is a collection of files that have to be unzipped in a subfolder (such as Bk). They are used all along the notebooks
